One ordinary day, I discovered I had a {adjective} superpower called {superpower}.\
At first, I tested it on a small {noun}, and it instantly {verb_present}.\
Shocked but excited, I decided to use my {superpower} in public.\
Soon, the entire {place} became {adjective_place}, and people started to notice.\
Groups of {plural_noun} followed me everywhere, asking for help.\
With great power came great responsibility, but being {adjective} made it all worthwhile.
