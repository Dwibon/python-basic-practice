# Python Basics Practice

I created this repository to contain small beginner-level Python programs while learning core Python concepts.  

They are meant for **practice and learning**, not as full-scale portfolio projects.

A simple interactive program that:
- Takes user input (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.)
- Generates a fun story using string formatting (f-strings)

**Concepts used:**
- input()
- Variables
- f-strings
- Basic string handling

File: `madlibs.py`

## Purpose of This Repository
- Practice Python fundamentals
- Build confidence with version control
- Serve as a learning log while progressing to larger projects

More programs may be added as learning continues.
